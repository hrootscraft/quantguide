What is the probability that at least two people in a group of three friends were born on the same day of the week?
<br><br>

**Notes**<br>
_When calculating probabilities for "at least" scenarios, you can use the complementary approach, which often simplifies calculations. Here's a general formula:
P(at least one event occurs) = 1 - P(none of the events occur)_

In our case, 
<br>P(atleast 2 share a day) 
<br>= 1 - P(none of them share a day ie all of them have distinct days) 
<br>= 1 - [(7/7)*(6/7)*(5/7)] 
<br>= 1 - 30/49 = 19/49.

For the first person, they can be born on any of the 7 days of the week.
<br>For the second person to have a different birth day, they have 6 remaining days.
<br>For the third person to have a different birth day from both, they have 5 remaining days.
