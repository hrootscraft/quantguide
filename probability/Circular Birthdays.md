7 people sit around a circular table uniformly at random. All of them have a distinct age. Find the probability that they sit down at the table in age order. Note that the ages can be increasing in either the clockwise or counter-clockwise directions.

**Notes**<br>
What we're looking for:
- 7 people with distinct ages sitting around a circular table
- We need the probability they sit in either clockwise or counterclockwise age order

In a circular arrangement, there are (7-1)! = 6! = 720 distinct seating arrangements. This is because we can fix the position of one person and arrange the remaining 6 people in 6! ways.
Now, among these 720 arrangements, how many have the people seated in age order?

There are only 2 ways to arrange the distinct aged people in age order around a circular table: clockwise (say, increasing order) and counterclockwise (ergo decreasing order).

Therefore:
<br>Number of favorable outcomes = 2
<br>Total number of possible outcomes = 720

The probability is: P = 2/720 = 1/360
